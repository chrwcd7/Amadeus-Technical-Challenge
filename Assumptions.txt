1) It is assumed that the input map is read from a file of the form like the one provided, "testmap.txt", 
   where each line contains the key and its respective value, separated with a space.
   The filename is given as a command-line argument to the program.

2) It is assumed that a value cannot reference multiple other keys, for example "foo${key2}bar${key3}" is not a valid value.

3) Is is assumed that each substitution happens according to the latest value of each key, even if it is changed from the original map.
   
   For example, given the map below
    "key1": "value1"
    "key2": "${key1}value2"
    "key3": "value3${key2}"

   The expected output will be 
    "key1": "value1"
    "key2": "value1value2"
    "key3": "value3value1value2"
